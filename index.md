# Pymanujan ♾️
#### Python powered calculator; but without `eval()`.

### Introduction
Whole code is written in Python. New developers and contribtors can easily go through the code to understand the logic behind the program. I tried to include as much comments and documentations within the code itself. Feel free to ping me for any queries. Best-suited for new developers this simple program provides a stage for develpoment of one's skill, expertise and familiarity of Python programming language.

Pymanujan can do these now:
  - ➕ Addition
  - ➖ Subtraction
  - ✖️ Multiplication
  - ➗ Division
  - ⭐ Exponentiation
  - 🔺 Trigonometric functions
  - 🔻 Inverse trigonometric functions
  - ❗ Factorial
  - 🌲 Logarithms
